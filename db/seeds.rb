# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# Team.destroy_all

# tigers = Team.create(:name => "Tigers")
# beez = Team.create(:name => "Beez")
# royals = Team.create(:name => "Royals")
# hornets = Team.create(:name => "Hornets")
# falcons = Team.create(:name => "Falcons")
# blasters = Team.create(:name => "Blasters")
